<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px; text-align:center;"> <em>Prologue</em> </h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
It was a late night when a druid monastery somewhere in Icewind Dale was raided by a tribe of goblins. As a last resort, many of the members joined hands to summon a fey to aid them in the battle, only to find they were too short of time. Now surrounded, the druids would watch a mishap take form; a product which had an intimating presence and strong stature - that of a reindeer. The goblins were amazed, some retreating when the creature before them demanded so, and the rest perishing for testing its patience. The druids thanked their new friend for the help while escorting the rest of the family to safety, but the creature took great interest in the goblins and chose to run away after them later that night. After tracking them down, the goblins would soon become fans of her as well as she threatened to crush anyone who stood in her way of becoming leader. She would go on to lead the tribe on hunts across the tundra for nothing else but the love of battle. However, being created through the elements of nature, she grew curious of the lands beyond the cold that she was so used to, and quickly made it tradition to part ways and travel through the Swordcoast during days of summer and spring as a bounty hunter for sport. </br> </br>
Upon one of her first jobs, she was tasked to hunt down a young priest within his hometown, which quickly spiraled into a deadly duel. The two would learn much during the bout, but both would find and share a sense of respect for they still had a lot to learn of the world. After just barely putting the fight to a stop, the cleric would introduce himself as Maxi and realize this in them, offering to let her stay at his cabin while Cera ventured through the south, where the two would be quick to become best friends. Maxi would then go on his own quest to explore his divine powers and meet more friends, only to return home early under a lingering guilt due to his inexperience with the magic he weld and fear of failing those around him. By now, tales of this quest have been heard throughout the Swordcoast, even reaching to the Cera's own tribe, where they would push her to take his place. Reaffirming her new friend, Cera promised to take on the quest herself before rushing off to find a group to aid in the cause, in hopes of proving both warriors worthy. </br> </br>
