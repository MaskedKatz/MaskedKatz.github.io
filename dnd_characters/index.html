<p style="text-align:center;"> Here is an archive of all characters I've played as through my time playing D&D and various samples of art I've done of them. All characters are listed by order created, even if I happen to pick them off the shelf to play as again later. "Level" refers to what level the character was before the last game they were in ended.

	<h2 style="text-align:center"> <u>Maxi</u> </h2>
		<p style="text-align:center">
		<u>Race:</u> Foxfolk (homebrew) | <u>Class:</u> Light Domain Cleric | <u>Campaigns:</u> 2 </br>
				</br>
				<img width=140 height=250 src="./assets/pic_maxi.png" alt="maxi" class="inline" />
				</br>
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/Masked_Katz/characters/13076569"> Character Sheet</a> </br>
		Maxi was my first ever character. While he likes making sure to be selfless by healing his friends, he also tries to be useful by dealing some damage of his own. He has his own fire power thanks to the Light domain, but he's also known for having an interest in necromancy spells, for better or for worse!
		</p> </br>
		
		
	<h2 style="text-align:center"> <u>Cera</u> </h2>
		<p style="text-align:center">
		<u>Race:</u> Deerfolk (homebrew) | <u>Class:</u> Barbarian | <u>Campaigns:</u> 1 <br>
				</br>
				<img width=125 height=250 src="./assets/pic_cera.png" alt="cera" class="inline" />
				</br>
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/Masked_Katz/characters/13189433"> Character Sheet</a> </br>
		Cera's design was made for an art contest, which took place entirely before my interest in D&D. While she is knowledgeable about her battle tactics, she's just as reckless. She will do whatever she can to get in peoples' faces and push herself to give it her all when it comes to dealing damage or getting people excited.
		</p> </br>
		
			
	<h2 style="text-align:center"> <u>Katzy II</u> </h2>
		<p style="text-align:center">
		<u>Race:</u> Tabaxi | <u>Class:</u> Pharaoh Domain Cleric (homebrew) | <u>Campaigns:</u> 2 </br> 
				</br>
				<img width=215 height=250 src="./assets/pic_katzy.png" alt="katzy" class="inline" />
				</br>
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/Masked_Katz/characters/23492286"> Character Sheet</a> </br>
		Katzy II's name (and base design) refers to my first ever non-D&D character named Katz. He is quite sassy but has a way with words. He always uses his magic to prove that he is the best, whether it be dealing massive damage, summoning undead servants, or raising his friends only when they're down.
		</p> </br>
		
		
	<h2 style="text-align:center"> <u>Nikki</u> </h2>
		<p style="text-align:center">
		<em> Pathfinder </em> </br>
		<u>Race:</u> Kitsune | <u>Class:</u> (Air: Lightning + Runes) Cleric | <u>Level:</u> 1 | <u>Campaigns:</u> 1 </br>
				</br>
				<img width=165 height=250 src="./assets/pic_nikki.png" alt="nikki" class="inline" />
				</br>
		Nikki is a funny case: I made him up on the spot. While a cleric at heart, Nikki takes the apperance of a cultist, using dark magic to look cool, but also help those in need. Most dislike him for his embarrasing behavior and lifestyle, but secretly, he is very intelligent and enjoys keeping the secret that it's just a persona.
		</p> </br>
			
				
	<h2 style="text-align:center"> <u>Maxi (Adult)</u> </h2>
		<p style="text-align:center">
		<u>Race:</u> Foxfolk (homebrew) | <u>Class:</u> Oathbreaker Paladin | <u>Campaigns:</u> 1 </br>
				</br>
				<img width=195 height=250 src="./assets/pic_maxi2.png" alt="maxi2" class="inline" />
				</br>
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/Masked_Katz/characters/28500816"> Character Sheet</a> </br>
		Maxi as an adult is honestly just an excuse for me to see him in action again. He temporarily has taken the job as a Paladin to help gather up the courage to show others how strong he truely can be on his own. Even if there's still a lot of new magic to learn, Maxi puts all his strength to the test to aid his new friends.

	<h2 style="text-align:center"> <u>Arcade</u> </h2>
		<p style="text-align:center">
		<u>Race:</u> Minotaur | <u>Class:</u> Oath of Glory Paladin | <u>Campaigns:</u> 1 </br>
				</br>
				<img width=200 height=250 src="./assets/pic_arcade.png" alt="coming_soon" class="inline" />
				</br>
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/Masked_Katz/characters/29266929"> Character Sheet</a> </br>
		After the players skipped an important NPC in my game, I didn't let the concept go to waste. Arcade, while coming from a wild tribe of minotaurs, ironically is one of the nicest and most patient adventurers you'll meet. He made the promise to use his supernatual strength to good use, an he does what he can to prove so.
