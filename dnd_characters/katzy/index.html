<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px; text-align:center;"> <em>Prologue</em> </h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
Somewhere among the deserts now unknown to the Forgotten Realms once resided a small isolated civilization of humans. A royal family of tabaxi ruled over, all praying to the gods of the Mulhorandi pantheon for protection. Tabú was the son to the queen of the land, destined by tradition to rule. His mother wasn't keen with his early decisions due his harsher nature, but found that the people valued his respect for balance. By the time of her death, many believed that Tabú was looked over by the gods, due to the potent divine magic he had been bestowed, proven to help give to those in need. However, the strict pharaoh wasn't very ambitious, insisting to stick with tradition to not become anything greater than those who ruled before him, in fear of disrespecting their legacy. However, this would eventually lead to a depression of sorts, as he found himself lost without the guidance of his mother. </br> </br>

One morning, Tabú experienced a divine intervention from an avatar of Re, God of the Sun. The deity had come to reassure him that his destiny truly was as fruitful as many had been lead him to believe, with potential to become a demigod himself, but only if he put a stop to the doubt he had as ruler of those who had looked up to him. Re would offer the sacred Boon of Immortality so that he could continue to provide until such a day came, with Tabú accepting with the promise of high hopes following in his reign. </br></br>

Unfortunately, Tabú would find that the number of his people had only dwindled in the centuries he watched over them. The Mulhorandi pantheon had been growing weaker, resulting in their connection to Tabú and his people fading and eventually severed, unbeknownst to him. Tabú was not powerful enough to sustain his legacy alone, full of guilt and assuming defeat as he would eventually become the last of his kind. Even his immortality would be revoked during the events of the Second Sundering, it being all he had left after surviving the dreaded Spellplague. Once mortal again, the Tabú would scavenge for equipment and venture out into the Sword Coast in hopes of fulfilling his destiny and making up to the those he had no choice but to leave behind.
