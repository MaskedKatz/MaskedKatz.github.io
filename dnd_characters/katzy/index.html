<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px; text-align:center;"> <em>Prologue</em> </h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
Somewhere among the deserts now unknown to the Forgotten Realms once resided an isolated civilization of humans. A royal family of tabaxi ruled over, praying to the gods of the Mulhorandi pantheon for guidance and blessings. Tabú was the son to the queen of the land, destined by tradition to rule. His now elderly mother wasn't keen with his early decisions due his harsher nature, but found that the people would value his respect for balance. After her death, Tabú would be on his own, though by now many believed that he was was looked over by the gods, due to his potent divine magic proven to help and provide those in need. However, the lawful pharaoh wasn't very ambitious, wishing only to stick with tradition and not grow in power beyond those who ruled before him in fear of disrespecting their legacy. However, this would eventually lead to a depression of sorts, as he found himself lost with no longer having anyone to look up to. </br> </br>
One early morning while on a walk through the streets, Tabú experiences a divine intervention from an aspect of Horus-Re, god of the sun. While in complete shock, the deity had come to reassure him, as his destiny truely is as fruitful as many had been lead him to believe, with potential of going on to become a god himself, but only if he put a stop to the doubt he had as the ruler of those who had looked up to him. He presented an offer to aid him in finding hope in his future: protection from the decay of time itself, the Boon of Immortality. In the moment, coming face to face with the only other being that could truly inspire him, Tabú accepted with the promise of high hopes following in his reign. </br> </br>
Unfortunately, Tabú would find great misfortune while put to the test, finding that the number of his people only dwindled in the centuries he watched over them. While his name was never tainted, it was apparent that he was not fit to make such a lasting legacy, only continuing to watch from his throne, restless yet defeated. This resulted in his connections to the gods fading and eventually severed, where even his boon had been revoked. With no one left, Tabú knew he had to take matters into his own hands, now as mortal as any other. For the first time in his life, he scavenged for equipment and ventured away from his home (which was now an overgrown jungle) into the Sword Coast. He had a whole new world to discover, all while wanting to make history once more to pay respects to his family and people that he had left behind.
