<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
Somewhere among the deserts now unknown to the Forgotten Realms once resided an isolated civilization of humans. A royal family of tabaxi ruled over, looking up to a parodied Egyptian pantheon, alike the Mulhorandi pantheon, for guidance. Tabú was the son to the queen of the land, destined by traditional to rule after he had matured, where he would then be known to take on a harsher approach to leadership and take on the title as "pharaoh" instead. His now elderly mother wasn't keen with his early decisions, but found his people eventually valued his respect for balance, feeling as if they had more influence on the land as he  did. After her death, Tabú was now on his own, though by now many believed that he was somehow connected to the gods due to his potent divine magic proven to help protect them and thought there was only good to come. However, the pharaoh had only wished to stick with tradition and didn't intend to grow in power beyond his family who ruled before him in fear of disrespecting their legacy, secretly leading to a depression as he found himself lost without anyone to look up to. </br>
One early morning while on a walk through the streets, pondering on his impact on his society, Tabú experiences a divine intervention from an aspect of Horus-Re, god of the sun. Tabú is paralyzed in disbelief as the deity reassures him that his destiny is fruitful as many had been lead to believe, but only if he didn't continue to doubt himself as ruler of those who looked up to him. He presented an offer to aid him in finding hope in his future: protection from the decay of time itself, the Boon of Immortality. In the moment, coming face to face with the only other being that truly inspire him, Tabú accepted with the promise of high hopes to come in his reign. However, he would find great misfortune as he had been put to the test, finding that the number of his people only dwindled in the centuries he watched over them. While his name was never tainted, it was apparent that he was not fit to make it last, hiding away in his tomb to reflect as the last of his people passed. Much more time passed as the defeated pharaoh laid restless, reflecting and thinking of how to go on after having nothing else to his name, eventually coming to the conclusion that his connection the gods had also begun to fade without the help of worship. Only during the Spellplague would this connection ultimately be severed, where Tabú would have to sacrifice his boon and the majority of his divine power to survive. It wasn't long after until he realized that he had to take matters into his own hands as he was now mortal like any other, leading him to emerge from his temple to find it to be buried under an overgrown jungle. After scavenging for equipment, he would venture out into the rest of the Sword Coast to find a way to make history once more with the little divine power he still had, not just to be remembered as he once desired, but also to pay respects to his late mother, people, and the gods, who he believes deserves to have their wishes fulfilled. </br>
