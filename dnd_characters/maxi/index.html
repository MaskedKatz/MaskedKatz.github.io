<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px; text-align:center;"> <em>Prologue</em> </h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
While young, Maxi was found stray in the wild by an old Laren, who then took it upon himself to raise him in his cabin in Neverwinter Wood. Laren would tell Maxi that he nor many others have ever seen a creature like him before, and he believed that he was a special gift from the gods - maybe his god Lathander, known for creativity, renewal, and birth - to create someone special. After learning to properly read and write, Maxi would go on to spend most of his time studying Laren's tomes and listening to his tales of going on adventures as a heroic paladin, in hopes of one day following him in his footsteps. However, Laren insisted that Maxi stayed home while he was out gathering these tomes and adventuring, afraid of how others would think of him. Instead, Maxi often found himself studying Laren's equipment and drawing in spare books of himself going on his own adventures, companied by his own magical "smiting hammer". </br> </br>
It took time to build up the courage over the years, but Maxi was ready to let Laren know he wanted to go out and see the world for himself. However, he would unfortunately discover that the old man died in his sleep. That's when he would hastily gather his father's equipment and run away from home for the first time in his life to mourn alone into the wilderness nearby. In his dreams that night - expected to be filled with fear and despair - Maxi would instead experience a divine intervention with Lathander himself, who knew Laren well for his great deeds and prayers made throughout the years. Maxi would be told he had a promising life of adventure ahead of him, as he had a lot to learn about Faerun and his father's past. He would awake in the cave where he had since passed out, with the morning light shining down upon him. In his hands, which once clutched onto Laren's beloved mace, now shined a magical hammer that resembled the very weapon featured in his drawings. Maxi would take this gift and vow to seek out more information about his father's legacy and the world he sought to protect. </br>

While getting to explore his hometown in person for the first time, a trusty Dwarfven tutor of Laren's would spot and greet the outsider. However, after it was revealed that his old paladin friend had just passed away while secretly hiding Maxi away from the public, he would rush off in a panic to consult his priestly colleagues. Believing that Maxi was spreading lies or potentially the cause of their dear hero's death, the Dwarf would discretely order for a bounty to be put on his head while they investigated. Fortunately for them, another outsider would make their way through town to take on this job. On his way home that very night just outside of town, Maxi would cross paths with the towering barbarian. Through quite the bout, he would learn how to use his new hammer and unleash his divine potential, the fight coming to an abrupt end by nearly setting the field ablaze. The bounty hunter would reveal herself as Cera, an amazon who had traveled from Icewind Dale yet was just as long as him, wanting to find a way to hunt as she used to. Gaining the respect of each other through this encounter, the two would walk away together, quickly becoming great friends and going on to relate through their need for adventure. </br> </br>
Nights later, Maxi and Cera would be greeted at his cabin by many of the town's acolytes, apologizing greatly after finding out the trouble their colleague had caused them. While offering to give his father a proper ceremony, Maxi would also be presented an opportunity to help another friend of theirs in Neverwinter -  a Dwarf who needed his goods escorted to a nearby town - in where he could practice his magic as his father once had. Cera would watch after his home as he immediately took the job head-on. Unfortunately, he would soon return to exclaim that while he made some great friends, such as the bard Zarad, he ultimately did not yet feel experienced enough for what lied ahead what he was presented. Cera would reassure him, suggesting to check out Candlekeep to learn more about the world and maybe even his father before adventuring forth once more, while she would part ways once more to continue his quest. </br> </br>
