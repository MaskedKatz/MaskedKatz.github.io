<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px; text-align:center;"> <em>Lost Mines of Phandelver Saga</em> </h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
While young, Maxi was found stray in the wild by an old Laren, who then took it upon himself to raise him in his cabin in Neverwinter Wood. Laren would tell Maxi that he nor many others have ever seen a creature like him before, and he believed that he was a special gift from the gods - maybe his god Lathander, known for creativity, renewal, and birth - to create someone special. After learning to properly read and write, Maxi would go on to spend most of his time studying Laren's tomes and listening to his tales of going on adventures as a heroic paladin, in hopes of one day following him in his footsteps. However, Laren insisted that Maxi stayed home while he was out gathering these tomes and adventuring, afraid of how others would think of him. Instead, Maxi often found himself studying Laren's equipment and drawing in spare books of himself going on his own adventures, companied by his own magical "smiting hammer". </br>
It took time to build up the courage over the years, but Maxi was ready to let Laren know he wanted to go out and see the world for himself. However, he would unfortunately discover that the old man died in his sleep. That's when he would hastily gather his father's equipment and run away from home for the first time in his life to mourn alone into the wilderness nearby. In his dreams that night - expected to be filled with fear and despair - Maxi would instead experience a divine intervention with Lathander himself, who knew Laren well for his great deeds and prayers made throughout the years. Maxi would be told he had a promising life of adventure ahead of him, as he had a lot to learn about Faerun and his father's past. He would awake in the cave where he had since passed out, with the morning light shining down upon him. In his hands, which once clutched onto Laren's beloved mace, now shined a magical hammer that resembled the very weapon featured in his drawings. Maxi would take this gift and vow to seek out more information about his father's legacy and the world he sought to protect. </br>
</br>
His first stop would be just outside the forest, the city of Nuwreck, where his father would frequently go out to trade for goods and equipment, as he recalled his stories featuring a merchant friend that went by the name of Raldrek. After spending a day exploring the city he had only heard descriptions of before, and getting funny looks in the process, he would find the dwarf trader maintaining his stall and serving the locals. As Maxi would approach to introduce himself as the son of the now late Laren, he would be met with a horrified face, as Raldrek was one of the few who was told of Maxi's existence, yet never believed him to be real. He told him to stay away, as he once saw Laren as a paladin who promised to protect the city but felt betrayed knowing he actually raised an outsider, or in his eyes, a monster. That night, frustrated with both the grief and terror that came with the learning of his friend's passing, Raldrek went out into the town square and put up a bounty for the fox.</br>
In the upcoming days, another outsider, the bounty hunter Cera, would enter town and strike terror in the rest of the locals with her towering posture. She would find the advertisement and snatch it for herself, finding the unique target to be a sort of calling. Unfortunately for Maxi, the two would meet just as he began to walk back into town that morning. Without an introduction, Cera would lunge herself and begin to attack, the two stumbling back into the forest as Maxi would be battered, begging for her to stop and explain what she was after. Only in peril would Maxi find his newfound powers granted by his mentor, sending flames forth through his Burning Hands, barely able to keep up with Cera's might, but ultimately putting an end to the carnage after heating up her metal breastplate up to scorching tempatures. Defeated, Cera would finally explain she had been sent away by her hobgoblin comrades, with the promise that she could return to the tribe after becoming strong enough to defeat a dragon on her own, thus she has taken on any challenge set before her. While the wiser Maxi picked up on the trick at play, he would find Cera's similar search for purpose to be charming, so he invited her back to his cabin where they could combine their might and train together. Even if Cera only agreed after gaining respect for his potential in combat, the two would go on to share their different stories and become good friends.</br>
</br>
After some time, Maxi would check Nuwreck's job board for himself, reading about a dwarf named Gundren in Neverwinter needing an escort to a small nearby town named Phandalin, in which Cera would encourage him to go after, as it was not only an opportunity to go on his first adventure, but also get information on another one of her targets: a mysterious Warlock who knew all the secrets the world had to offer, rumored to hide just outside of Phandalin. Maxi would prepare and head out onto the trail, only days later meeting up with Gundren and other adventurers: a half-elf bard, half-orc barbarian, human wizard, and a blue dragonborn who was also a cleric.</br>
Over the course of their first day of travel, the adventurers' wagon would pass by a hidden goblin hideout and be ambushed. While not in the best shape, the party would fight back and come out on top. After arriving to the town and delivering the goods, they would be quick to learn of the town's bandit problem, where Maxi would find a few of the criminals picking on one of the townspeople. He and his fellow cleric friend would confront the bandits, where they would test Maxi's patience. Wanting to be looked down upon no longer, Maxi swung his hammer into one of their heads with Inflict Wounds, melting the body before him completely, leaving the rest of the cohort in complete shock as they were dealt with by the rest of the party as they caught up to the scene. While initially horrified after lashing out, Maxi would find himself thrown up into the air by his new friends and grateful townspeople as they cheered for his efforts, ultimately boosting his confidence but fueling a new fascination for necromancy magic.</br>
Over the course of the next few nights, the adventurers would become familiar with each other and their abilties, whether they were fighting off giant spiders, breaking up an army of raider orcs, or even putting a stop to a cultist and his army of zombies; especially Maxi and the bard, Zarad, as the two taught each other much about what different ways of life had to offer. However, there was an apparent growing concern for Maxi, as he relied more and more on necromancy and its dangerous power. However, this confidence would be the drive Maxi needed to defeat the Redbrand bandits once and for all. After some planning, the gang would disguise themselves late in the night to find and sneak into their hideout, where they would then battle through hoards of the thieves, free their prisoners, and end their reign. The next night, the gang would celebrate with the townsfolk in the inn, where Maxi would also be confronted by the dragonborn about his dangerous obsession with the magic he had used. This made Maxi feel guilty for the stress he had caused to those he looked up to, but he saw this as just another learning experience and opportunity to prove himself. After growing in strength and helping as much as he had, Maxi left his friends in good graces to return back home, only to find his close friend Zarad had caught up to him just before leaving, where he would be convinced for the two to share one last night together, sharing stories and reminiscing on their times together.</br>
</br>
On his long hike back to his cabin, Maxi was more alert while traversing Never Winterwood as he was now on his own. This lead to him finding a corpse on the ground - one with the same red cloak the Redbrand bandits had worn. Suspect of a secret runaway hideout, he investigated the area carefully, only to find a run-down monastery among the greenery, where he would cautiously enter. Sneaking down a spiral staircase lead him to an ancient garden, only dimly lit by candles that decked the walls, along with the blood belonging to the several bodies laying across the ground before a small hooded figure who sat in meditation - the warlock he had been keeping an eye out for. Maxi, in disbelief with the scene he found himself in, accused the figure of competing with the bandits - only for it to jump up to interrupt and ask what the cleric was seeking. Maxi said he was on the search for information about Laren and his past - introducing himself not only as an enemy to the bandits, but to all who hide away in the darkness and use its magic. The figure then claimed that he had no reason to share what he knew, and wanted to be left alone to continue his study on the magic embodying the temple, all while he sat back down to tend to his ritual. This ignorance would only enrage Maxi, sending him swinging, only to find the figure matching him in power with ease. He then introduced himself as a sage named Nikki, claiming that he pretended to be a lot of things - and being Maxi's rival wouldn't be the first. With so many questions unanswered - Nikki's similar divine magic, similar yet uncanny appearance, and if he would ever learn about his father's legacy on his own - left Maxi emotionally defeated, as he crashed before Nikki in exhaustion. The warlock would then reveal that while he may seem vigilant, his secret was his intellect and ability to deceive. He gave the hint to take a break from adventuring, and to head to the library fortress Candlekeep - a place he knew well for its promise of such knowledge - when Maxi was once again ready to call himself a hero. Nikki then fled the scene after wishing his new rival good luck as he slept among the corpses. Maxi would return home a few days later, still trying to comphrend the encounter he got himself into but taking the advice to heart, settling down for a couple of years to learn more about the world, its people, its traditions, and its threats before getting himself into more trouble than he can handle.</br>
