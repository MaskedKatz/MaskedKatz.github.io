<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px; text-align:center;"> <em>Prologue</em> </h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
While young, Maxi was found stray in the wild by an old Laren, who then took it upon himself to raise him in his cabin in Neverwinter Wood. Laren would tell Maxi that he nor many others have ever seen a creature like him before, and he believed that he was a special gift from the gods - maybe his god Lathander, known for creativity, renewal, and birth - to create someone special. After learning to properly read and write, Maxi would go on to spend most of his time studying Laren's tomes and listening to his tales of going on adventures as a heroic paladin, in hopes of one day following him in his footsteps. However, Laren insisted that Maxi stayed home while he was out gathering these tomes and adventuring, afraid of how others would think of him. Instead, Maxi often found himself studying Laren's equipment and drawing in spare books of himself going on his own adventures, companied by his own magical "smiting hammer". </br> </br>
It took time to build up the courage over the years, but Maxi was ready to let Laren know he wanted to go out and see the world for himself. However, he would unfortunately discover that the old man died in his sleep. That's when he would hastily gather his father's equipment and run away from home for the first time in his life to mourn alone into the wilderness nearby. In his dreams that night - expected to be filled with fear and despair - Maxi would instead experience a divine intervention from Lathander himself, who knew Laren well for his great deeds and prayers made throughout the years. Maxi would be told he had a promising life of adventure ahead of him, as he had a lot to learn about Faerun and his father's past. He would awake in the cave where he had since passed out, with the morning light shining down upon him. In his hands, which once clutched onto Laren's beloved mace, now shined a magical hammer that resembled the very weapon featured in his drawings. Maxi would take this gift and vow to seek out more information about his father's legacy and the world he sought to protect. </br>

While getting to explore his hometown in person for the first time, a trusty Dwarfven tutor of Laren's would spot and greet the outsider. However, after it was revealed that his old paladin friend had just passed away while secretly hiding Maxi away from the public, he would rush off in a panic to consult his priestly colleagues. Believing that Maxi was spreading lies or potentially the cause of their dear hero's death, the Dwarf would discretely order for a bounty to be put on his head while they investigated. Fortunately for them, another outsider would make their way through town to take on this job. On his way home that very night just outside of town, Maxi would cross paths with the towering barbarian who was quick to attack. Though quite the bout, he would learn how to use his new hammer and unleash his divine fire magic, the fight coming to an abrupt end by nearly setting the field ablaze. The bounty hunter would then reveal herself as Cera, an amazon who had fled from Icewind Dale during the summer in search for a job while exploring the Sword Coast. Gaining the respect of each other through this encounter, the two would walk away together, quickly becoming great friends and going on to relate through their need for adventure. </br> </br>
Nights later, Maxi and Cera would be greeted at his cabin by many of the town's acolytes, apologizing greatly after finding out the trouble their colleague had caused them. While offering to give his father a proper ceremony, Maxi would also be presented an opportunity to help another friend of theirs in Neverwinter -  a Dwarf who needed his goods escorted to a nearby town - in where he could practice his magic as his father once had. Cera would watch after his home as he immediately took the job head-on. Unfortunately, only a Tenday later he would return to exclaim that while he made some great friends, such as Zarad the bard, he ultimately did not yet feel experienced enough for what lied ahead. Cera would reassure him, suggesting to check out Candlekeep - the library fortress - to learn more about the world and maybe even his father before adventuring forth once more, while she would part ways once more to continue his quest for him. </br> </br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
A month has passed, and after presenting his background and laying eyes upon the Emerald Door, Maxi would eventually become part of the Avowed. There he would make friends with Ason, Eli, and Valentina, all of which were also there to seek greater knowledge, and together they would climb up the ranks by taking out tests and favors under their new hag apprentice, Jenny Greenteeth, with promise of one day being able to enter and obtain the information they seeked. They would also meet the mysterious necromancer named Orikson who would keep an eye out on the scholars on their ventures. He had ties to each of their pasts, claiming to be one of the few people still around to have once worked alongside Laren during trying times. Maxi openly admits to looking up to him for this, but Orikson is quick to remind him of his blantly evil nature and that he would eventually know better. From escaping an old sage's puzzling mansion, to putting a stop to a shady merchant's bazaar of magical wares, to even recovering a desecrated sancturary in Sune's name from evil hags in disguise, Maxi and his corhorts would work their way up to earning the title of Scribe. However, Jenny would reveal their next mission would be their greatest yet most dangerous, involving skipping between different planes to reach the doomed Barovia, and face its unjust ruler, Strahd von Zarovich. Maxi promised his peers that he would return after, powerful enough to help those in need that they had met along the way up to this point.</br> </br>
It would be a treacherous journey there, with the party meeting many people and creatures along the way, such as a friendly hag that fortold keys events ahead with tarrot cards. There were also priests and other adventurers caught up in the troubles of a mysterious cult of Orcus, but nothing the party couldn't put a stop to. They would eventually enter the mist of the domain, generally unwelcomed by its untrustful people and creatures that lurked in the dark. However, this would slowly change as they would soon gain the trust of Krezk by reviving the burgomaster's son and later proving their power to it's abbot, a fallen celstial in disguise. They would also heal a once dying elder of the Vistani people, challenge an ancient hero's spirit to a duel as to finish its story, and even put what was to be the spirit of Strahd's long lost love to rest. During these ventures, Strahd's loyal servants would intervene but fall before them as they grew in power, catching the attention of their master. The heroes also went to go on to explore the Amber temple, where they would be find many more cultists of Orcus, slaying all that stood in their path now knowing they were a true threat. Strahd would finally begin to show up himself and take the party on, proving to have many different forms that only made him stronger with each defeat.</br> </br>
With the hope that they brought to the land, the party would gain many allies and even items, such as Maxi's Helm of Brillance and Holy Symbol of Ravenkind before the party's showndown with the vampire lord, which would soon come when invited to Castle Ravenloft to have dinner and face what else it had in store. Strahd, now in his last form, awaited them as they explored and evaded his monsters and traps within. It was when the party took a rest where Maxi would doze off and Strahd would strike - believed to use the remaining magic from his previous form to put Maxi in a deep, magical sleep. Nothing could wake him but another divine intervention from Lathander like once before, Maxi being told that he was destined for much more and would be sure to see the day. Maxi would be given the power needed to break the curse and awake, finding himself atop a wyvern with his friends. Apparently enough time had passed that they had managed to defeat Strahd and ultimately lend control to the hags they had since befriended, bringing hope to the land once more and earning the titles of Keeper of Tomes upon returning to Candlekeep. However, the cult of Orcus had plans this whole time to take over the world, unleashing countless demons and sending Neverwinter into ruins while the party was distracted while working on their previous mission, but the heroes were now on their way to make things right.</br> </br>
