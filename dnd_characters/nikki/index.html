<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px; text-align:center;"> <em>Prologue</em> </h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
In the shadows of Baldur's Gate, lightfoot cultists would make their way through the storms of the night to meet in a discrete labyrinth under the roads of the city. These priests and servants of Talos pray for blessings in preperation for their plan to destroy and rebuild the city from the ground up in their own vision. A particular superstitious necromancer of the court would imagine that using remains of their sacrifices to create their own berserker would not only help with their regime but also earn their god's respect. Over time this experiment would catch the attention of the entire family, coming to fruition when a flesh golem would climb out of an infused iron casket that had been struck with lightning. The creature would serve its family well, known for its unusual hunger for knowledge, always willing to learn. However, after becoming so sentient, it would begin to question its own purpose and ultimately come to the conclusion that the cult of destruction went against everything it had learned by creating it in the first place. The now paranoid creator would realize this change in additude and schedule for a ritual to be made the following morning. </br> </br>
The golem would be captured and be thrown through a Gate into the Abyss before it came a true threat, but while being hurled through the hells, a demon would capture it and return it to the material plane. Apparently, this greater demoness, only known as Jezebaal, had been spying on the cult and its activites, intrigued by watching their evil plans unfold. However, she became fascinated by the golem and grew attached as she realized she could a story of its own yet had to be developed. She offered her powers and protection in turn for its affection and the knowledge they both sought. The two would make a great team as the golem used this power to first carve out its own identity. He, now known as Nikki, swore to still bring the destruction of Talos - but only onto the evil who hid in the shadows - in a sort of twisted revenge. Now disguised as a lost cultist of Set (of the Mulhorandi pantheon), Nikki would mask his intelligence to seek, absorb, and contain the dark secrets of the world so they don't fall into the wrong hands, seemingly traveling between worlds when the need is great with the help of his lover.
