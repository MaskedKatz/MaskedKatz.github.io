<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
In the shadows of Baldur's Gate, lightfoot cultists would make their way through the storms of the night to meet in a discrete labyrinth under the roads of the city. These priests and servants of Talos plan to use their blessings to destroy and build the city from the ground, even bringing sacrifices as to when lightning would strike down upon them for blessings. A particular superstitious necromancer of the court would imagine that using such remains to create their own warrior would not only help with their regime but also earn their god's respect. Over time this experiment would catch the attention of the entire family, coming to fruition when a flesh golem would climb out of an infused iron casket. The creature would serve its family well, known for its unusual hunger for knowledge, always willing to learn. One night, it would ultimately question its own purpose, coming to the conclusion that a cult of destruction resorting to creation is nothing but heresy. However, the now paranoid creator would realize this and schedule for a ritual to be made the following morning. </br> </br>
The golem would be captured and be thrown through a Gate into the Abyss as its peers plead, but while being hurled through the hells, a demon would capture it and return it to the material plane. Apparently, this greater demon, only known as Jezebaal, watched over it since its creation - and what became a fascination - its fate. She offered her powers and protection in turn for affection and the knowledge they both sought. The two would make a great team as the golem used this power to first form and carve its own identity. He, now known as Nikki, swore to still bring the destruction of Talos - but only onto the evil who hid in the shadows - in a sort of twisted revenge. Now disguised a lost cultist of Set, Nikki would mask his intelligence to seek and destroy such powers and to learn the dark secrets of the world so the innocent don't have to, seemingly traveling between planes when the need is great with the help of his lover to do so. Those who have come face to face with his magic have been pierced by the lighting strikes of Talos or consumed by the hellish flames of Jezebaal.
