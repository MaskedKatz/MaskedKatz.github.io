Nikki hates anything evil, at least that which can effectively harm the innocent, and will do what he can to destroy it. He is oddly sadistic in such efforts, going as far as to pretend he himself is mischieveous himself to throw off potential enemies and even the most loyal of allies. However, he similarly finds great joy making a fool of himself and taking control of the chaos around him. In fact, much of his magic seems to embody chaos itself, as he prefers to summon alien creatures to do his bidding or conjure voids of explosive yet colorful energy. He and his lover even have a record of unique spells they've created, based on the unique yet alien magic they've experienced. </br>
Nikki's alignment is Chaotic Good. </br>

<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px; text-align:center;"> <em>Prologue</em> </h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px">
In the shadows of Baldur's Gate, lightfoot cultists would make their way through the storms of the night to meet in a discrete labyrinth under the roads of the city. These priests and servants of Talos pray for blessings in preperation for their plan to destroy and rebuild the city from the ground up above in their own vision. A particular superstitious necromancer of the court would imagine that using remains of their sacrifices to create their own berserker would not only help with their regime but also earn their god's respect. Over time this experiment would catch the attention of the entire family, coming to fruition when a flesh golem would climb out of an infused iron casket that had been struck with lightning. The creature would serve its family well, known for its unusual hunger for knowledge, always willing to learn. However, after becoming so sentient, it would begin to question its own purpose and ultimately come to the conclusion that the cult of destruction went against everything it had learned by creating it in the first place. The now paranoid creator would realize this change in additude and schedule for a ritual to be made the following morning. </br> </br>
The golem would be captured and be thrown through a Gate into the Abyss before it came a true threat, but while being hurled through the hells, a demon would capture it and return it to the material plane. Apparently, this greater demoness, only known as Jezebaal, had been spying on the cult and its activites, intrigued by watching their evil plans unfold. However, she became fascinated by the golem and grew attached as she realized she could a story of its own yet had to be developed. She offered her powers and protection in turn for its affection and the knowledge they both sought. The two would make a great team as the golem used this power to first carve out its own identity. He, now known as Nikki, swore to still bring the destruction of Talos - but only onto the evil who hid in the shadows - in a sort of twisted revenge. Now disguised as a lost cultist of Set (of the Mulhorandi pantheon), Nikki would mask his intelligence to seek, absorb, and contain the dark secrets of the world so they don't fall into the wrong hands, seemingly traveling between worlds when the need is great with the help of his lover's conjuration magic.

Due to his fear that the cult of Talos would seek him out and destory him after learning he had survived, Nikki suggested to Jezebaal that they retreat to other worlds to continue his adventure to conquer evil and gain strength to one day foil the cult's own plans. The first destination was Golarion (of Pathfinder fame), which Nikki seemed to prefer for its abundance of magic. However, with their connection to Talos and the abyss nearly severed, they eventually decided to retreat once more to another world known as the Land of Elentia. He found that this plane was quiet yet had lot to offer, curiously not growing weak like he had previously, encouraging the pair to explore. After finding their footing while making friends through many wild quests, they started hearing rumors of a group of adventurers coming across crystals containing negative energy. Jezebaal suggested that this was a calling of sorts, and the two followed suit. </p>
